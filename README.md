# RESThopper: Web Interface <br> (WIP)
---

##### Intro
RESThopper is, at its heart, a grasshopper API and thus any frontend can be constructed to interface with your grasshopper definitions run remotely on a server.

Eventually this will hosted several projects to allow users to send grasshopper scripts to a RESThopper server through a web interface. These clients pass parameters and a grasshopper script to the server and display resulting geometry in a ThreeJS Scene. Note that these are under development. For the time being you cant clone this with the expectation that anything will actually work...
